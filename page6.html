                                <b>Employee Count:</b> This is simply the total number of employees we have in our dataset. It gives us a quick look at the size of our workforce.<br><br>

                                <b>Attrition Count:</b> This tells us how many employees have left our company. When we see "Yes" in the Attrition column, it means an employee has left.<br><br>
                                
                                <b>Attrition Rate:</b> This is like a percentage that shows us how fast employees are leaving. It's calculated by dividing the Attrition Count by the total Employee Count.<br><br>
                                
                                <b>Average Income:</b> This is the typical or average monthly income of our employees. It helps us understand the salary range within our company.<br><br>
                                
                                <b>Average Age:</b> This is the average age of our employees. It gives us a sense of the age group we mostly have in our workforce.<br><br>
                                
                                <b>Employee Count by Gender:</b> Here, we're counting how many male and female employees we have. It's useful for understanding gender diversity in our company.<br><br>
                                
                                <b>Attrition by Education:</b> This metric helps us see if employees with different education levels are leaving at different rates. Are those with more education leaving less?<br><br>
                                
                                <b>Employee by Age:</b> We're categorizing our employees into different age groups to see how many fall into each group. It helps us understand our workforce's age distribution.<br><br>
                                
                                <b>Attrition by Satisfaction:</b> This tells us if employees who are less satisfied are leaving more often. It's important because we want to keep our employees happy.<br><br>
                                
                                <b>Years at Company:</b> This shows us how long our employees have been with us. It helps us understand our workforce's experience level.<br><br>
                                
                                <b>Salary Hike by Job Role:</b> We're looking at how much each job role's salary typically increases. Some roles might get bigger raises than others.<br><br>
